> Now that you have explored the basics, you are ready to see how you can make your app better with SQL Server. In this module we will show you a simple example of [Columnstore Indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-overview) and how they can improve data processing speeds. Columnstore Indexes can achieve up to 100x better performance on analytical workloads and up to 10x better data compression than traditional rowstore indexes.
